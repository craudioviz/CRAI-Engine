# \*\*Modular Intelligence for Emotionally Resonant AI Avatars\*\*

# 

# CRAI-Engine is the core framework powering Vizara â€” a modular, emotionally intelligent AI designed to engage, adapt, and evolve. Built by \[CR AudioViz AI](https://craudioviz.ai), this repo reflects our commitment to scalable architecture, zero-friction deployment, and emotionally resonant design.

# &nbsp; Handles short-term and long-term memory, context retention, and recall logic.

# 

# \- \*\*CreativeEngine\*\*  

# &nbsp; Generates emotionally intelligent responses, visuals, and voice.

# 

# \- \*\*ExecutionLayer\*\*  

# &nbsp; Orchestrates task flow, API calls, and modular plugin execution.

# 

# \- \*\*InterfaceLayer\*\*  

# &nbsp; Connects CRAI to front-end experiences (chat, voice, AR, etc.).

# 

# \- \*\*CloudSync\*\*
